        <h3>Biography</h3>
<p>I am a software engineer with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering and a Master's degree in Computer Science. I am licensed as a Professional Engineer (P.Eng.) with the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of BC (APEGBC).</p>

<p>Currently I work at DreamCraft Attractions in Victoria, BC, where I develop software for the amusement park and video game industries. Our flagship product is a virtual reality system where the user sits on a motion platform, which simulates the forces of flying, driving, etc. I worked on an SDK for this system, and installed hardware and software at the client's site. This gave me experience developing and maintaining a complex, safety-critical engineering system.</p>

<h3>Projects</h3>
